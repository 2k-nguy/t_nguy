                        <p>Hello! I'm Thienkim Nguyen, a Computer Science student with a passion for data science and software engineering. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Python, Java, and C, I've developed a keen eye for problem-solving and data analysis.</p>

    <p>My journey in the tech industry began with participation in Google's Computer Science Summer Institute, where I immersed myself in project-based learning and collaborated with industry professionals. During my internship at Enterprise Hall, I leveraged my web development expertise to create impactful digital solutions aligned with organizational objectives. Through involvement in Girls Who Code, I demonstrated my commitment to using technology for social good by developing a Python-based chatbot addressing gender inequality.</p>

    <p>I am particularly skilled in utilizing Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, as showcased in my YouTube API Data Analysis project. Additionally, my projects like Space Challenge and Connect4 demonstrate my proficiency in software development methodologies and user-centric design.</p>

    <p>As a lifelong learner, I am always eager to explore new innovations in the tech industry, particularly in the fields of AI, data science, and machine learning. I am actively seeking opportunities as a research assistant, software engineering intern, data science intern, machine learning intern, or teaching assistant to further expand my knowledge and contribute to innovative projects.</p>
